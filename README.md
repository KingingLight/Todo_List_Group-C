Simple Task Management Web Application

Introduction:
Our project aims to create a simple yet effective task management web application using PHP and MySQL. The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward interface for organizing their to-do lists.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a functional task management system that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks. Specifically, the project aims to:
1. Establish a connection to the MySQL database for storing task data.
2. Create an intuitive user interface for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.
3. Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed or pending.
4. Ensure data integrity and security through proper validation and sanitization of user inputs.

Technologies Used:
	PHP: Server-side scripting language for dynamic web page generation.
	MySQL: Relational database management system for storing task data.
	HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for creating the user interface.
	Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive and mobile-friendly design.

Project Structure:
1. config.php: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
2. index.php: Main page of the application displaying a list of tasks and providing options to add, update, and delete tasks.
3.add.php: Handles the addition of new tasks to the database.
4.delete_task.php: Deletes a task from the database based on the task ID.
5.update_task.php: Updates the status of a task to "Done" when marked as completed.
6.style.css: Contains styles for customizing the appearance of the application.

Features:
1.Add Task: Users can enter a new task in the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
2.View Tasks:Tasks are displayed in a table format showing the task description and status (pending or done).
3.Update Status: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Complete" button next to each task.
4.Delete Task: Tasks can be deleted from the list by clicking the "Remove" button next to each task.
5.Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
